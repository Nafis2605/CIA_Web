// src/core/vr/VRSpatialMenuModel.js
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// VR Spatial Menu Model — pure layout + hit-test + action-dispatch logic
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// WebXR immersive sessions (Safari/visionOS and most browsers) do NOT render
// the DOM, so a React component like VRWristMenu is invisible in-headset. The
// guaranteed in-session UI is therefore drawn as in-scene VTK geometry by
// VTKVRSpatialUI. This module is the geometry-free brain of that panel:
//
//   - button layout (id → local-space rect on the panel quad)
//   - hit testing (a UV point on the panel → which button, if any)
//   - action dispatch (button id → a call on the injected manager surface)
//   - show/hide bookkeeping keyed on VR session start/end
//   - selected-tool / isolation reflection so the panel never disagrees with
//     the manager (single source of truth = VRExplorationManager state)
//
// It holds NO React and NO VTK references — everything visual/stateful lives
// behind the `manager` surface injected at construction. That keeps it unit
// testable in jsdom and keeps core/ free of UI deps.
//
// COORDINATE CONVENTION
// The panel is a unit quad in "panel UV" space: u ∈ [0,1] left→right,
// v ∈ [0,1] bottom→top. Buttons are laid out in one or more equal-width
// horizontal rows, stacked bottom→top by ascending `row` index (row 0 is the
// bottom row). VTKVRSpatialUI maps this UV space onto a world-space quad
// anchored in front of the head; the raycast hit it feeds back in is already
// reduced to a (u, v) pair, so this module stays free of 3D math.
