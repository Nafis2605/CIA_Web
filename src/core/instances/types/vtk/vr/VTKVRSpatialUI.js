// VR Spatial UI - in-scene tool menu for immersive WebXR sessions
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// WHY IN-SCENE (NOT DOM)
// WebXR immersive sessions on Safari/visionOS and most browsers do NOT render
// the page DOM, so the React VRWristMenu is invisible once the headset is on.
// To let a user pick tools / toggle isolation / leave VR without removing the
// headset, the menu is drawn as VTK geometry inside the same scene the data
// lives in — a head-anchored quad panel with one button cell per action.
//
// The DOM VRWristMenu remains the pre-session / 2D fallback. Both read the same
// source of truth (VRExplorationManager via VRSpatialMenuModel), so they can
// never disagree.
//
// ANCHORING
// The panel floats ~1.2 m in front of the head, dropped well below eye-line
// and offset to one side so it reads as a chest-level/peripheral HUD instead
// of sitting on the same forward ray as an auto-fit dataset (which would
// otherwise visually block it). It re-anchors lazily: it only follows the
// head once the head has drifted past a comfort threshold, so it feels
// world-stable while you inspect but comes back when you turn to look for it.
//
// SELECTION
//  - Controller ray: the target ray is intersected with the panel plane; a
//    persistent hover highlight tracks the pointed button, and a rising-edge
//    trigger commits the tap.
//  - Vision Pro transient-pointer (gaze + pinch): there is no persistent hover
//    ray, so there is no hover highlight; a pinch (select) at the gaze target
//    intersects the panel and commits directly (tap-select).
//
// This file is the thin VTK layer; all layout / hit-region math / action
// dispatch lives in VRSpatialMenuModel (pure, unit-tested).
